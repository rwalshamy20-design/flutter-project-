# Flutter Store Application
The idea is to build a simple Flutter-based mobile application that acts as an online marketplace. Users can browse products, view details, and purchase items. Sellers can list products with images, descriptions, and prices. The goal is to create a clean, lightweight, and easy-to-use platform suitable for a basic e-commerce workflow.
